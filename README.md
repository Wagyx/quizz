# Quizz Game
A static JavaScript fully client-side web app to create and play quizz games with your friends.

This project is realized with pure HTML 5 and vanilla JavaScript with [Bulma.io](https://www.bulma.io) as the CSS framework.

With the editor, the quizz master may create the questions for a quizz game and save it to a Json file that is to be shared with players. With the player, players will load the quizz file and start a session where they have limited time to figure out answers to the questions. At the end, players shall save their answers (as a Json file) and send them back to the quizz master.
Finally, with the corrector, the game master may load the quizz file and the players' answers to attribute points according to his own judgement. The result will tell who the winner is.

This is perfect if you want to play remotely with your friend over Discord.

Have a good game !
